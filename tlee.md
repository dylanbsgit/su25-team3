# Your Name

## About Me
Hello, my name is Terrance R. Lee and as long as I can remember, I've always loved technology and software, especially when it comes to operating systems within flagship cellular device devices. I would love to use my computer science degree to be a data analyst and a private software developer after hours.

## My CSC340 Goals
Last semester, I took web development as an elective and I learned a lot about making a web application in this class. I hope to learn what it takes to engineer software and what the processes of software development looks like from start to continium.
